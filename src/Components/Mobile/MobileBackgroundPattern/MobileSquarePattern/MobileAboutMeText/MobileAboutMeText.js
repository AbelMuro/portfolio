            I’m a full-stack web developer and UX/UI designer based 
            in the Bay Area, California. For the past seven years, 
            I’ve been crafting web applications that fuse technical 
            precision with elegant design. Perfection isn’t just a goal—it’s my standard. 
            I invest the countless hours required to produce clean, performant code 
            that satisfies clients and positions them for success. My obsession 
            with quality drives me to eliminate inefficiencies and resolve every 
            bug until the result becomes <span>art</span>. With strong collaboration skills, 
            I elevate development teams, transforming the process of building software 
            into a fluid and beautiful craft. To me, software is a passionate 
            expression capable of generating beauty in a stagnant world.
